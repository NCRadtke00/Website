        <p3>Like most people I put my pants on one leg at a time, the only difference is that once mine are on I never stop striving to be the best I can be. I'm a member of the United States Army Reserves, with the 452ND Combat Support Hospital.</p3>
        <p3>I studied International Econmics and Finance at University of Wisconsin Milwaukee before finding my passion in coding. In 2020 I begin to refine my skills in coding with the wonderful help I recieved at devCodeCamp.</p3>
